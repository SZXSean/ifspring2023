        <br>
        This website includes detailed cooking instructions on how to cook the dish step by step, including some small tricks to cook better. Also, with the help of the ingredients checklist, it is straightforward for the users to follow during the preparation process without missing anything important.

    <li><a href="https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/lanzhou-beef-noodle-soup/"> China Sichuan Food </a> 
        <br>
        This website is even better in some content compared to the website above: it attaches the photos of each step, making it more vivid for the users to follow up rather than simply looking at the words. Moreover, this website makes the cooking process into parts. So, the users could prepare the toppings, noodles, and drizzles separately. This allows them to be more organized.

        <br>
        This website includes another dish, but one thing that catches my attention is that it shows the cooking process and has a button to adjust serves easily. The ingredients change along with the serving amount, making it much easier for the users to prepare food for different groups of people. It also demonstrates the time cost of each step, making the whole process more controlled.

<h2>Non-Recipe Sites</h2>

    <li><a href="https://www.nurturedigital.com/">nurturedigital</a> 
        <br>
        This website uses a very effective combination of background color, font style, font size, and layout to create a solid visual effect and visual hierarchy to highlight the content. It is imperative to think of how users access information from the webpage.
        </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> 
        <br>
        This website visually allocates all the images precisely and directly with the help of the evenly distributed rows and columns and the white spaces. In the recipe, many images will be presented. This website might offer a way of a better arrangement. 
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://the-talks.com/"> The Talk</a> 
        <br>
        This website reaches a balance between images and text content. Since there are many text instructions in the recipe, I can get some idea of typography designs from it.
