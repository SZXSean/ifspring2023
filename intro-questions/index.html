        <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</strong></li>
            <p>My name is Zhixuan(Sean) Shen. I am a junior architecture student.</p>
            <li><strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong></li>
            <p>I like designing. I also enjoy programming. I want to use code as another language to express and explain my design ideas.</p>
            <li><strong>you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong> </li>
            <p>Last semester, I took a course Web Development. I learnt a little bit about how to use html, css and js to build a simple website, but I am not very experienced.</p>
            <li><strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong></li>
            <p>In the past, I learned a lot about pure research methodology and the design process as an architect. Last semester was my first time getting in touch with HTML and using raw code to build up a whole website. Because of lacking the skills, I wasn't able to focus on the design part, interaction, and user experience. In this course, I would like to find the balance between design and functionality, trying to create a website with better interaction and thus increase the engagement of users.</p>
            <li><strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong></li>
            <p>From my perspective, the design on paper is still, flat and obvious. The way people access information is planned. Even with the help of fonts, size, and indentation, people still can get everywhere on paper with a simple glance without any change. However, the design on the screen is dynamic and the process is linear, allowing it to navigate people with the hierarchy of information.</p>
            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
            <p>I think <a href="http://blacknegative.com/#!/loader/">blacknegative</a> is a very powerful and effective design. It demonstrates the different possibilities of the users' navigation and accessibility to information. The use of high-resolution photographs, videos, dark backgrounds, fonts, and interesting interaction methods highlight the combination of multi-media content and the harmonic flow between.</p>
            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
            <p><a href="https://www.hellomonday.com/">Hellomonday</a> has an atypical design for communicating with the users. This website explores a new way of showing digital ideas, user experiences, brands, and products alive. In the interaction, the fun hovering and animation display the stunning execution of visual effects for the users while being served, making it more interesting and eye-pleasuring, communicating the information to the users. </p>
            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
            <p><a href="https://rainforest.arkivert.no/#kart">Rainforest.arkivert</a> utilizes diverse content: 360-panoramic images, unique stories, and live videos to create an immersive experience for the user to know all about the Yanomami tribe of the Amazon, including the villages, natives, and waterways. Throughout the website, the smooth transitions and navigation mechanics effectively and precisely capture the users' attention, connecting people with their social case, and converting this inside pulse to the volunteering activities that protect nature.</p>
